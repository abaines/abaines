### Hi there 👋, I'm Alan Baines 🧡

I'm a senior software engineer who lives and breathes science, engineering, and computers. 
With over a decade of experience, I am passionate about contributing to a team's success by building robust, scalable, and maintainable software.

As a strong advocate for **Open Source, DevOps, and CI/CD automation**, I have a passion for assimilating team standards and automating them.
My goal is to act as a **force multiplier** for my team, boosting performance through collaborative knowledge sharing, mentoring, code reviews, and pair-programming.

I thrive in high-autonomy, high-trust environments that value a "marathon, not a sprint" philosophy.
My focus is on long-term sustainability in both the products we build and the culture we cultivate.
As a neurodivergent professional, I leverage my unique perspective for creative and systematic problem-solving.
I am a firm believer in "fail-fast" programming and the "broken-window principle," constantly seeking opportunities to improve systems and processes.

I am seeking a senior, high-impact, remote, non-management technical role where I can champion the **Developer Experience (DevEx)** and help the team grow and succeed.
